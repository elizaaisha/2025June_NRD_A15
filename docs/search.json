The NRD enables tracking of individual patients across hospitalizations within a given year via synthetic identifiers, capturing discharges from U.S. community hospitals and supporting survey-weighted national estimates through complex sampling design.\nCohort Definition:\nIndex hospitalizations were included if they met all of the following criteria:\n\nAdults aged ≥18 years\nPrincipal diagnosis of thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic dissection, identified using ICD-10-CM codes: I7101 and I7103\nNon-elective admission\nIndex discharge by the end of November to allow for a complete 30-day follow-up period\nComplete data on NRD_DAYSTOEVENT, required to compute discharge dates\n\nOutcomes of Interest:\n\nPrimary Outcomes:\n\nPredictors of 30-day readmission\n\nSecondary Outcomes:\n\nIn-hospital mortality (binary)\nLength of stay (LOS, in days)\nTotal hospitalization charges (inflation-adjusted to 2017 USD)\n\n\nOutcome Definitions:\n\nReadmission:\n\nDefined using NRD’s linkage variables.
